                    <h2>Musical Tradition</h2>
                    <p>Turkey has a rich musical tradition of varied and often contrasting styles. Turkey lies at
                        the
                        axis
                        of the cultures of East, West, Mediterranean, Middle East and Islam. Anatolia's cultural
                        variety is
                        so rich that you can see great cultural differences even in areas geographically quite
                        close to
                        each other. This colorful portrait holds just as true for Turkey's music.</p>
                    <h2>Music Festivals</h2>
                    <p>There are a number of prominent music festivals in Turkey including the <b>Aspendos Opera</b>
                        and <b>Ballet
                            Festival</b> which is held in <b>June</b> and <b>July</b> and the <b>Istanbul Music</b>
                        and
                        <b>Jazz
                            Festivals</b>.</p>
                    <p>Also, popular music industry in Turkey boosted by the MTV style TV channels playing non-stop
                        music

                        <h2>Turkish Musical Instruments</h2>
                        <p>There are a number of musical instruments in Turkey such as:</p>
                        <p>• <b>Stringed Instruments</b>: Saz, Baglama, Ud, Tar</p>

                        <h2>Classical Turkish Music</h2>
                        <p>Classical Turkish music is monophonic, meaning all instruments essentially play the same
                            tune.With the formation of the Turkish Republic, a form of modern polyphonic Turkish music
                            began to
                            develop and there are now numerous successful classical composers. In this music the Turks
                            own a
                            multitude of patterns composed of a series of committees were created.</p>

                    <p>In the period prior to the proclamation of the Republic in Turkey, opera, ballet and the theatre
                        were mostly centred around Istanbul and Izmir. The first showing of opera at the imperial court
                        was by artists trained by <b>Guiseppe Donizetti</b> (1788-1856) from the <b>Italian opera</b>.</p>

                    <p>Turkish architects who signed many successful projects around the world, are the touchstones of
                        modern architecture.</p>
                    <p>Today there are a number of established architectural firms that deserve mention. Modern
                        architectural works have influenced several generations of Turkish architects and received

                        <h2>Traditional Turkish Houses</h2>
                        <p>The architecture of traditional Turkish houses is influenced by a variety of climactic and
                            natural resources, by the traditions of earlier houses remaining in Anatolia from the
                            Byzantine era, and by traditional Turkish culture, which was brought from Central Asia by
                            the Turks.</p>
                        <p>Local materials, both natural and inorganic, give Turkish houses their character and
                            identity; in North Anatolia, the wooden houses from rich forests; while in Central
                            Anatolia, the stone and sun-dried brick houses; in West Anatolia, stone; and in South
                            Anatolia, stone and wooden houses.</p>
                        <p>In conjunction with these principles, the interiors of Turkish houses were planned for
                            different purposes, like the winter and the summer rooms. In addition, Islamic and Turkish
                            customs played a great part in shaping the house. This factor brought on a common plan,
                            which made Turkish houses more homogenious, though there were still climatic and regional
                            differences.</p>

                            political
                            and social in substance. The great and politically controversial poet, Nazim Hikmet,

                    <p>Turkish cinema began to be talked about on international platforms in the 1980s. As this process
                        continued, films dealing with social and psychological matters and women's rights came to the
                        fore. The 1990s saw fewer films, but of a more advanced quality. Among the reasons for this
                        progress were the arrival of cinema studies in universities, the training of knowledgeable
                        directors and actors and state support for the cinema. Yet another reason was international
                        success.</p>

                            along
                            an oral tradition, with plays performed in public places, such as coffee houses and
