                        Surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans, Australia is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas, with the Coral
                        Sea lying off the Queensland coast, and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand. The
                        world's smallest continent and sixth largest country by total area, Australia—owing to its size and
                        isolation—is often dubbed the "island continent", and is sometimes considered the world's largest
                        island. Australia has 34,218 kilometres (21,262 mi) of coastline (excluding all offshore islands),
                        and claims an extensive Exclusive Economic Zone of 8,148,250 square kilometres (3,146,060 sq mi).
                        This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory. Apart from Macquarie
                        Island, Australia lies between latitudes 9° and 44°S, and longitudes 112° and 154°E. The Great Barrier
                        Reef, the world's largest coral reef, lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends
                        for over 2,000 kilometres (1,240 mi). Mount Augustus, claimed to be the world's largest monolith,
                        is located in Western Australia. At 2,228 metres (7,310 ft), Mount Kosciuszko on the Great Dividing
                        Range is the highest mountain on the Australian mainland. Even taller are Mawson Peak (at 2,745 metres
                        or 9,006 feet), on the remote Australian external territory of Heard Island, and, in the Australian
                        Antarctic Territory, Mount McClintock and Mount Menzies, at 3,492 metres (11,457 ft) and 3,355 metres
                        (11,007 ft) respectively.
