                        Prehistoric period See also: Indigenous Australians Human habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to have begun
                        around 65,000 to 70,000 years ago, with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea-crossings
                        from what is now Southeast Asia. These first inhabitants were the ancestors of modern Indigenous
                        Australians. Aboriginal Australian culture is one of the oldest continual civilizations on earth.

                        of European settlement in the late 18th century, most Indigenous Australians were hunter-gatherers
                        with complex economies and societies. Indigenous Australians have an oral culture with spiritual
                        values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime. The Torres Strait Islanders,
                        ethnically Melanesian, obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of
                        their reefs and seas. The northern coasts and waters of Australia were visited sporadically by Makassan
                        fishermen from South Peninsula, Sulawesi.
