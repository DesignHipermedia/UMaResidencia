            <h2>Food</h2>
            <p align="justify">From lamb in spring to fish in summer, stews and soups in winter and, of course, potatoes at almost any time of the year, Irish food involves simple, hearty, family cooking that follows the seasons.

            <h3>Soda bread</h3>
              <img src="soda-bread.jpg" class="img">
                <p align="justify">Every family in Ireland has its own recipe for soda bread, hand-written on flour-crusted note paper and wedged in among the cookery books. Some like it sweet with a spoonful of honey, sugar or dried fruits. Others prefer sprinkled-in seeds, bran and oats for a health boost, or treacle and Guinness for the opposite effect. However, the basic ingredients don’t change (bicarbonate of soda and buttermilk form the raising agent, which is mixed in with flour) and nor does the way it’s eaten: sliced and spread liberally with butter.

                  <img src="shelfish.jpg" class="img">
               <p align="justify">Visit Ireland outside of summer and your chances of seeing the sun may be slim. On the plus side, you'll be able to feast on the west coast’s plump native oysters (Ostrea edulis), which come into season in September, and pay a visit to the Galway Oyster Festival (28-30 September). Shellfish abound in Irish cuisine, from clams in Connemara to Molly Malone’s famed cockles and mussels, and Dublin Bay prawns, which have their own festival held in Howth.

                      <img src="irish-stew.jpg" class="img" >
                    <p align="justify">One-pot cooking doesn’t get much simpler than Irish stew, traditionally made with mutton, onions and potatoes (the addition of carrots can be a divisive issue). To avoid the stew being watery (a childhood horror for many of us), some recipes recommend adding pearl barley, a spoonful of roux or sliced potatoes, while others reduce the liquid by leaving the stew to simmer. These days, you’re more likely to find Irish stew made with lamb (as the more flavourful mutton is harder to come by), with stock and herbs – such as thyme, parsley and bay leaves – adding depth of flavour.

                        <p align="justify">The name Coddle was originated from coddling or the slow cooking of ingredients. The slices of sausage are stewed in slow fire for hours along with other ingredients such as bacon, sliced onions and potatoes.
    
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify"> For the best taste, use a high-quality pork sausage and bacon, then serve Coddle with some soda bread.</p>

                              <img src="Full_Ulster_fry.jpg" class="img" >
                            <p align="justify">This is a typical Irish breakfast, but most common around Ulster. However, others would have the Ulster fry not for breakfast alone but all throughout the day. Usually, it is served with slices of soda or potato bread.

                            <p align="justify"> On other parts of Ireland particularly in the South, it is like a breakfast roll while in the north, Ulster fry consists of soda farl, bacon, eggs, and fried sausages. Mushrooms and fried onions are the common toppings upon request.</p>
