                      <img src="colin.jpg" class="img">
                    <p aling="justify">Irishman Colin Farrell set his footprints firmly on the Hollywood timeline with his performance in the film ‘Tigerland’. Since then, this Dubliner has given several award-winning performances with some of the best directors and co-stars. Born and brought up in Dublin, Farrell was inspired to take up acting after watching the classic Spielberg film, E.T. It was on his brother’s insistence that he joined a drama school and began learning the nuances of acting. However, he was inducted into television even before he could finish his course. A few television series and films later, he got noticed and carved his niche as an accomplished actor. With his rapid rise to stardom, came a rambunctious lifestyle - heavy smoking, drinking and partying. Farrell often found himself in the midst of fights and brawls. This highly boisterous way of life got him into many gossip columns and tabloids for issues as embarrassing as drugs, rehab and leaked tapes of intimate moments with co-stars. However, Farrell took it all in his stride and has been giving good performances on screen. He has lent his support for many charitable causes, as well.
