            <p align="justify">Welcome to the Emerald Isle! A land of rolling greenery, craggy mountains, mysterious Celtic ruins, crumbling castles, leprechaun-dotted forests, shanty pubs set to the ditties of Gaelic folk, rowdy beer bars and salt-sprayed coastlines, Ireland really is a wonder to behold.</p>

                <p align="justify">Here, we take a look at 3 of the top spots that every traveler heading to this hearty corner of Western Europe should have on the menu.
            </p >
                <p align="justify">Lets explore our list of the best places to visit.</p>

            <h3>1. Cliffs of Moher</h3>
              <img src="Cliffs-of-Moher.jpg" class="img">
              <p align="justify">One of the most visited natural attractions in all of Ireland, the Cliffs of Moher rise up from the swells of the great Atlantic Ocean like petrified bulwarks of stone.</p>
               <p align="justify"> On top, they are covered with the island’s trademark meadows of verdant green grass, while the waters of Galway Bay crash and froth against the stone below.</p>
                
               <p align="justify">At a whopping 120 meters in height, these great cliffs offer dramatic views of the coastline and the Aran Islands out at sea, while an all-new visitors’ center makes it easy for travelers to uncover the hundreds of millions of years of geological history that helped form the stratas of sandstone and shale.</p>

                <h3>2. Sligo</h3>
                  <img src="sligo.jpg" class="img">
                  <p align="justify">While the small and welcoming town of Sligo packs a punch with its charming medieval core, arched stone bridges, lichen-spotted abbey and wealth of pretty 19th-century townhouses, it’s the backcountry of this one that really hits the mark.</p>
                  <p align="justify">Imbued with all the romance you’d expect of the place that helped form the legendary W B Yeats, this area of outstanding natural beauty rises to peaks with the mighty monolith of Knocknarea Mountain (the mythic resting place of Queen Maedbh), comes peppered with moss-clad, centuries-old cairn stones and makes for some truly breathtaking views over the pebble beaches and salt-sprayed towns of Sligo Bay.</p>

                      <img src="park.jpg" class="img">
                      <p align="justify">Nestled amidst the other much-vaunted natural treasures of County Kerry, the indelibly wild and untouched reaches of the Killarney National Park are surely worth a mention in their own right.</p>
                      <p align="justify">Attested by UNESCO and trodden by herds of majestic red deer, the area hosts great swathes of primeval oak, yew and ash forest.
                      <p align="justify">These come interspersed with the beautiful Lakes of Killarney, which sit mirror-like under the curiously-hued tops of the Purple Mountains.
                      </p>
                      <p align="justify">The whole place is a veritable mecca for walkers and wildlife lovers, who can weave between peat bogs, moss-caked forests and more, all in the company of swifts, kingfishers and ospreys.

                        <h3>4. Powerscourt House and Gardens, Co. Wicklow</h3>
                          <img src="cavalo.jpg" class="img">
                         <p align="justify">Superb views, serene lakeside walks, engaging history, and the stunning backdrop of Sugarloaf Mountain are just some of the treats in store when visiting this magnificent home, just 20 kilometers from Dublin. Now owned by the Slazenger family, the house is set on 47 manicured acres. Take time to stroll through the Rose and Kitchen Gardens and explore the beautiful Italian Gardens. There are more than 200 varieties of trees, shrubs, and flowers, and particularly moving is a section where much-loved family pets were buried complete with headstones and inscriptions. The gardens were laid out over a period of 150 years and were designed to create an estate that blends harmoniously with the surroundings. On site, in the former Palladian home, are craft and design shops and an excellent café/restaurant. Truly one of the most majestic attractions in Ireland, a visit here shouldn't be missed. </p>

                              <img src="castle.jpg" class="img">
                             <p align="justify">Possibly Ireland's best-known attraction, the Blarney Stone sits high on a tower of Blarney castle, not far from Cork. Reputed to endow the famed Irish eloquence to those who dare hang their head over the parapets to kiss it, the stone is not the only reason for visiting Blarney Castle. </p>
