                <h3>Location</h3>
                <p> Great Britain lies on the European continental shelf, part of the Eurasian Plate. Situated off the
                    north-west coast of continental Europe, it is separated from the mainland by the North Sea and by
                    the English Channel, which narrows to 34 km (18 nmi; 21 mi) at the Straits of Dover. It
                    stretches over about ten degrees of latitude on its longer, north-south axis and occupies an area
                    of 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi), excluding the smaller surrounding islands.</p>

                <p>The English Channel is thought to have been created between 450,000 and 180,000 years ago by two
                    catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods caused by the breaching of the Weald-Artois Anticline, a
                    ridge that held back a large proglacial lake, now submerged under the North Sea. Around 10,000
                    years ago, during the Devensian glaciation with its lower sea level, Great Britain was not an
                    island, but an upland region of continental northwestern Europe, lying partially underneath the
                    Eurasian ice sheet. The sea level was about 120 metres (390 ft) lower than today, and the bed of
                    the North Sea was dry and acted as a land bridge, now known as Doggerland, to the Continent.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="geo2">
                <h3>Geology</h3>
                <p>Great Britain has been subject to a variety of plate tectonic processes over a very extended period
                    of time. Changing latitude and sea levels have been important factors in the nature of sedimentary
                    sequences, whilst successive continental collisions have affected its geological structure with
                    major faulting and folding being a legacy of each orogeny (mountain-building period), often
                    associated with volcanic activity and the metamorphism of existing rock sequences. As a result of
                    this eventful geological history, the island shows a rich variety of landscapes.</p>

                <p>The oldest rocks in Great Britain are the Lewisian gneisses, metamorphic rocks found in the far
                    north west of the island and in the Hebrides (with a few small outcrops elsewhere), which date from
                    at least 2,700 Ma (Ma = million years ago). South of the gneisses are a complex mixture of rocks
                    forming the North West Highlands and Grampian Highlands in Scotland. These are essentially the
                    remains of folded sedimentary rocks that were deposited between 1,000 Ma and 670 Ma over the gneiss
                    on what was then the floor of the Iapetus Ocean.</p>

                <p>At the present time the north of the island is rising as a result of the weight of Devensian ice
                    being lifted. Southern and eastern Britain is sinking, generally estimated at 1 mm (1/25 inch) per
                    year, with the London area sinking at double the speed partly due to the continuing compaction of
                    the recent clay deposits.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="geo3">
                <h3>Fauna</h3>
                <p>Animal diversity is modest, as a result of factors including the island's small land area, the
                    relatively recent age of the habitats developed since the last glacial period and the island's
                    physical separation from continental Europe, and the effects of seasonal variability. Great
                    Britain also experienced early industrialisation and is subject to continuing urbanisation, which
                    have contributed towards the overall loss of species. A DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food
                    and Rural Affairs) study from 2006 suggested that 100 species have become extinct in the UK during
                    the 20th century, about 100 times the background extinction rate. However, some species, such as
                    the brown rat, red fox, and introduced grey squirrel, are well adapted to urban areas.</p>

                <p>Rodents make up 40% of the mammal species. These include squirrels, mice, voles,
                    rats and the recently reintroduced European beaver. There is also an abundance of European
                    rabbit, European hare, shrews, European mole and several species of bat. Carnivorous mammals
                    include the red fox, Eurasian badger, Eurasian otter, weasel, stoat and elusive Scottish
                    wildcat. Various species of seal, whale and dolphin are found on or around British shores and
                    coastlines. The largest land-based wild animals today are deer.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="geo4">
                <h3>Flora</h3>
                <p>In a similar sense to fauna, and for similar reasons, the flora is impoverished compared to that of
                    continental Europe. The flora comprises 3,354 vascular plant species, of which 2,297 are native
                    and 1,057 have been introduced. The island has a wide variety of trees, including native
                    species of birch, beech, ash, hawthorn, elm, oak, yew, pine, cherry and apple. Other trees have
                    been naturalised, introduced especially from other parts of Europe (particularly Norway) and North
                    America. Introduced trees include several varieties of pine, chestnut, maple, spruce, sycamore and
                    fir, as well as cherry plum and pear trees. The tallest species are the Douglas firs; two
                    specimens have been recorded measuring 65 metres or 212 feet. The Fortingall Yew in Perthshire
                    is the oldest tree in Europe.</p>

                <p>There are at least 1,500 different species of wildflower. Some 107 species are particularly rare
                    or vulnerable and are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It is illegal to uproot
                    any wildflowers without the landowner's permission. A vote in 2002 nominated various
                    wildflowers to represent specific counties. These include red poppies, bluebells, daisies,
                    daffodils, rosemary, gorse, iris, ivy, mint, orchids, brambles, thistles, buttercups, primrose,
                    thyme, tulips, violets, cowslip, heather and many more.
                    There are also many species of algae and mosses across the island.</p>
