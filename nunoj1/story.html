                <h3>Prehistoric period</h3>
                <p>The island was first inhabited by people who crossed over the land bridge from the European
                    mainland. Human footprints have been found from over 800,000 years ago in Norfolk and traces of
                    early humans have been found (at Boxgrove Quarry, Sussex) from some 500,000 years ago and
                    modern humans from about 30,000 years ago.</p>

                <p>Until about 14,000 years ago, Great Britain was connected to Ireland, and as recently as 8,000 years
                    ago it retained a land connection to the continent, with an area of mostly low marshland joining it
                    to what are now Denmark and the Netherlands. In Cheddar Gorge, near Bristol, the remains of
                    animal species native to mainland Europe such as antelopes, brown bears, and wild horses have been
                    found alongside a human skeleton, 'Cheddar Man', dated to about 7150 BC. Thus, animals and humans
                    must have moved between mainland Europe and Great Britain via a crossing. Great Britain became
                    an island at the end of the last glacial period when sea levels rose due to the combination of
                    melting glaciers and the subsequent isostatic rebound of the crust.</p>

                <p>Great Britain's Iron Age inhabitants are known as Britons; they spoke Celtic languages.</p>

                <h3>Roman and medieval period</h3>
                <p>The Romans conquered most of the island (up to Hadrian's Wall in northern England) and this became
                    the Ancient Roman province of Britannia. In the course of the 500 years after the Roman Empire
                    fell, the Britons of the south and east of the island were assimilated or displaced by invading
                    Germanic tribes (Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, often referred to collectively as Anglo-Saxons). At
                    about the same time, Gaelic tribes from Ireland invaded the north-west, absorbing both the Picts
                    and Britons of northern Britain, eventually forming the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century. The
                    south-east of Scotland was colonised by the Angles and formed, until 1018, a part of the Kingdom of
                    Northumbria. Ultimately, the population of south-east Britain came to be referred to as the English
                    people, so-named after the Angles.</p>

                <p>Germanic speakers referred to Britons as Welsh. This term came to be applied exclusively to the
                    inhabitants of what is now Wales, but it also survives in names such as Wallace and in the second
                    syllable of Cornwall. Cymry, a name the Britons used to describe themselves, is similarly
                    restricted in modern Welsh to people from Wales, but also survives in English in the place name of
                    Cumbria. The Britons living in the areas now known as Wales, Cumbria and Cornwall were not
                    assimilated by the Germanic tribes, a fact reflected in the survival of Celtic languages in these
                    areas into more recent times. At the time of the Germanic invasion of Southern Britain, many
                    Britons emigrated to the area now known as Brittany, where Breton, a Celtic language closely
                    related to Welsh and Cornish and descended from the language of the emigrants, is still spoken. In
                    the 9th century, a series of Danish assaults on northern English kingdoms led to them coming under
                    Danish control (an area known as the Danelaw). In the 10th century, however, all the English
                    kingdoms were unified under one ruler as the kingdom of England when the last constituent kingdom,
                    Northumbria, submitted to Edgar in 959. In 1066, England was conquered by the Normans, who
                    introduced a Norman-speaking administration that was eventually assimilated. Wales came under
                    Anglo-Norman control in 1282, and was officially annexed to England in the 16th century.</p>

                <h3>Early modern period</h3>
                <p>On 20 October 1604 King James, who had succeeded separately to the two thrones of England and
                    Scotland, proclaimed himself "King of Great Brittaine, France, and Ireland". When James died in
                    1625 and the Privy Council of England was drafting the proclamation of the new king, Charles I, a
                    Scottish peer, Thomas Erskine, 1st Earl of Kellie, succeeded in insisting that it use the phrase
                    "King of Great Britain", which James had preferred, rather than King of Scotland and England (or
                    vice versa). While that title was also used by some of James's successors, England and Scotland
                    each remained legally separate countries, each with its own parliament, until 1707, when each
                    parliament passed an Act of Union to ratify the Treaty of Union that had been agreed the previous
                    year. This created a single kingdom out of two, with a single parliament, with effect from 1 May
                    1707. The Treaty of Union specified the name of the new all-island state as "Great Britain", while
                    describing it as "One Kingdom" and "the United Kingdom". To most historians, therefore, the
                    all-island state that existed between 1707 and 1800 is "Great Britain" or the "Kingdom of Great
                    Britain".</p>
