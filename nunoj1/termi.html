                <h3>Toponymy</h3>
                <p>The archipelago has been referred to by a single name for over 2000 years: the term 'British Isles'
                    derives from terms used by classical geographers to describe this island group. By 50 BC Greek
                    geographers were using equivalents of Prettanikē as a collective name for the British Isles.
                    However, with the Roman conquest of Britain the Latin term Britannia was used for the island of
                    Great Britain, and later Roman-occupied Britain south of Caledonia.</p>

                <p>The earliest known name for Great Britain is Albion (Greek: Ἀλβιών) or insula Albionum, from either
                    the Latin albus meaning "white" (possibly referring to the white cliffs of Dover, the first view of
                    Britain from the continent) or the "island of the Albiones".</p>

                <p>The oldest mention of terms related to Great Britain was by Aristotle (384–322 BC), or possibly by
                    Pseudo-Aristotle, in his text On the Universe, Vol. III. To quote his works, "There are two very
                    large islands in it, called the British Isles, Albion and Ierne".</p>

                <h3>Derivation of Great</h3>
                <p>The Greco-Egyptian scientist Ptolemy referred to the larger island as great Britain and to Ireland
                    as little Britain inhis work Almagest. In his later work, he gave the islandsthe names
                    Alwion, Iwernia, and Mona, suggesting these may have been the names
                    of the individual islands not known to him at the time of writing Almagest. The name Albion
                    appears to have fallen out of use sometime after the Roman conquest of Britain, after which Britain
                    became the more commonplace name for the island.</p>

                <p>After the Anglo-Saxon period, Britain was used as a historical term only. Geoffrey of Monmouth in
                    his pseudohistorical Historia Regum Britanniae refers to the island as Britannia major
                    , to distinguish it from Britannia minor, the continentalregion which approximates to modern
                    Brittany. The term Great Britain was first used officially in 1474,
                    in the instrument drawing up the proposal for a marriage between Cecily the daughter of Edward IV
                    of England, and James the son of James III of Scotland, which described it as "this Nobill Isle,
                    callit Gret Britanee".</p>

                <h3>Modern use of the term Great Britain</h3>
                <p>Great Britain refers geographically to the island of Great Britain. It is also often used to refer
                    politically to the whole of England, Scotland and Wales, including their smaller off shore
                    islands. While it is sometimes used to refer to the whole of the United Kingdom, including
                    Northern Ireland, this is not correct.</p>

                <p>Similarly, Britain can refer to either all islands in Great Britain, the largest island, or the
                    political grouping of countries. There is no clear distinction, even in government documents:
                    the UK government yearbooks have used both Britain and United Kingdom.</p>

                <p>GB and GBR are used instead of UK in some international codes to refer to the United Kingdom,
                    including the Universal Postal Union, international sports teams, NATO, the International
                    Organization for Standardization country codes ISO 3166-2 and ISO 3166-1 alpha-3, and international
                    licence plate codes.</p>

                <p>On the Internet, .uk is the country code top-level domain for the United Kingdom. A .gb top-level
                    domain was used to a limited extent, but is now obsolete because the domain name registrar will not
                    take new registrations.</p>
